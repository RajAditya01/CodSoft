# CodSoft MERN Stack Project - Level 3

Welcome to the CodSoft MERN Stack Project - Level 3 repository! This project is part of the CodSoft internship program, focusing on mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for web development.

## Project Overview

The Level 3 MERN stack project is designed to challenge interns with more advanced concepts and functionalities of web development using the MERN stack. Interns will build a full-stack web application from scratch, incorporating various features and technologies learned throughout the internship.

## Project Requirements

To successfully complete the Level 3 MERN stack project, interns are required to:

- Design and implement a full-stack web application using the MERN stack.
- Utilize MongoDB as the database for storing and managing data.
- Implement RESTful APIs using Express.js for server-side logic and routing.
- Develop a dynamic and responsive user interface using React.js for the frontend.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for user management.
- Incorporate additional features and functionalities based on project requirements.
